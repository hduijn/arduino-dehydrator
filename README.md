# arduino-dehydrator
Dehydrator project based on Arduino

## Synopsis

Dehydrator project using Arduino for creating custom dehydrators. 

## Code

Code of the project can be found in arduinocode folder, code is still a bit messy but working. 

## Fritzing

Schema with parts is created in Fritzing, sketch and parts can be found in Fritzing folder. In the Fritzing/exports folder the dehydrator schema can be found in png format.

## 3D models 

3D models of LCD case in STL_3D folder, Files are modified from http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:30073
I've printed them with .2mm layer thickness and the case was a bit to small to fit rotary encoder and display properly. 
My advise is to print is slightly larger or just don't use the files for printing but only for inspiration.
